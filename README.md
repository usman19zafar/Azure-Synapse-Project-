Azure Synapse Data Engineering Project

NOTE: To provide a meaningful answer, it’s important to first understand the exact question being asked. These notes are simply my personal reflections and learning aids—they help me maintain a more human, personalized touch in my own study process. They are not a substitute for official documentation, and anyone following along should always refer to the platform’s official library for complete and authoritative guidance.

Please also remember that I’m not responsible for the accuracy of the content here. These are just my notes, written without full context, and they may not capture every detail or nuance of the underlying technology.

Educational & Demonstration Purpose Only
This repository contains a structured collection of theory notes, SQL code samples, procedural walkthroughs, and explanatory documents created as part of an educational project focused on Azure Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, data type inference, schema optimization, and data engineering fundamentals.

The goal of this project is to:

Demonstrate a range of technical skills

Practice Synapse Serverless querying patterns

Explore schema inference vs. explicit typing

Build procedural discipline through SOP‑style documentation

Provide a student‑grade learning artifact, not a production system

Disclaimer
This project is intended strictly for learning and educational exploration.
It is not designed, tested, or validated for production workloads.

The code samples are simplified for clarity.

The theory notes are written to support understanding, not enterprise deployment.

The procedures are meant to help students and early‑career engineers build confidence and structure.

If this repository helps others learn, that’s a bonus — but it should not be used as a reference for real‑world production systems without proper review and adaptation.
